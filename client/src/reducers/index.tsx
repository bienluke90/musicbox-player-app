      Right after summer, it's time for the full 'Mirage' album to take over. Inspired and influenced by many different types of music, 'Mirage' is more diverse than any other Armin album before. His collaboration with Sophie Ellis-Bextor, 'Not Giving Up On Love' is a perfect example of that, combining the best of both worlds. Armin:"The Nervo Sisters, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and me met up to write the vocals for 'Not Giving Up On Love'. I was thrilled to work with them on this. We gave it a more analog feel with some real drums, to give it a pop-rock feel. We also put a piano top line on the track and then the vocals of Sophie, which I think is a win. It's a lush summer tune with an epic vocal that gets stuck in your head and cheers you up!"
      
      'Mirage' is filled with musical fusions and surprising interpretations, from the orchestral masterpiece of title track 'Mirage', deep trance track 'I Don't Own You' and housy 'Feels So Good' to the eerie 'Take A Moment' and feel-good 'Drowning'. 16 tracks that highlight how Armin has matured as an artist.

      TiÃ«sto (Dutch pronunciation: [tiÉ›sto]; born Tijs Michiel Verwest [tÉ›Éªs mixiÉ« vÉ™rÊ‹É›st] on January 17, 1969) is a Dutch musician, DJ and record producer of electronic dance music. Although he has used many aliases in the past, he is best known for his work as DJ TiÃ«sto. On his latest productions, however, he has dropped the "DJ" label and is now known simply as "TiÃ«sto", an alias which is an Italian twist of his childhood nickname.
      
      In 1997 he founded the label Black Hole Recordings with Arny Bink, where he released the Magik and In Search of Sunrise CD series. In 1999 and 2000 he collaborated with Ferry Corsten to create Gouryella. His 2000 remix of Delerium's "Silence" featuring Sarah McLachlan exposed him to more mainstream audiences. In 2001 he released his first solo album In My Memory which gave him several major hits that launched his career. He was named "Worldâ€™s No.1 DJ" 3 consecutive times by DJ Magazine from 2002 through 2004.`,

Take note of the speed of graphics that coincides with the tempo of the dance music. Tiesto was introduce to me by Chery May last year and since then, na hook na ako sa kanyang mga mixes.
      
          TiÃ«sto (Dutch pronunciation: [tiÉ›sto]; born Tijs Michiel Verwest [tÉ›Éªs mixiÉ« vÉ™rÊ‹É›st] on January 17, 1969) is a Dutch musician, DJ and record producer of electronic dance music. Although he has used many aliases in the past, he is best known for his work as DJ TiÃ«sto. On his latest productions, however, he has dropped the "DJ" label and is now known simply as "TiÃ«sto", an alias which is an Italian twist of his childhood nickname.
          
          In 1997 he founded the label Black Hole Recordings with Arny Bink, where he released the Magik and In Search of Sunrise CD series. In 1999 and 2000 he collaborated with Ferry Corsten to create Gouryella. His 2000 remix of Delerium's "Silence" featuring Sarah McLachlan exposed him to more mainstream audiences. In 2001 he released his first solo album In My Memory which gave him several major hits that launched his career. He was named "Worldâ€™s No.1 DJ" 3 consecutive times by DJ Magazine from 2002 through 2004.`,
